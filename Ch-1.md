   - Criminal Law is concerned with laws pertaining to voilations of the rule of law or public wrongs and punishment of the same. Criminal Law is governed under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Crpc).

   - Murder, rape, theft, fraud, cheating and assualt  are some examples of criminal offences under the law.
2. ### Civil Law :- ###

Civil court enforces the violation of certain rights and obligations through the institution of a civil suit. Civil Law primarily focuses on dispute resolution rather than punishment. The act of process and the administration of civil law are governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). Civil law can be further classified into law of Contract, Family Law, Property Law, and Law of Tort.

A judgement delivered by the Supreme Court will be binding upon the courts within the territory of India under Article 141 of the Indian Constitution. The Doctrine of *Stare Decisis* is the principle supporting common law. It is a Latin phrase that means "to stant by that which is decided". 

- The Doctrine of *Stare Decisis* reinforces the obligation of courts to follow the same principle or judgement established by previous decision while ruling a case where the facts are similar or "on all four legs" with the earlier decision.

4. ### Principle of Natural Justice :- ###
